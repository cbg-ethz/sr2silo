### Wrangling Short-Read Genomic Alignments for SILO Database

This project will wrangle short-read genomic alignments, for example from wastewater-sampling, into a format for easy import into [Loculus](https://github.com/loculus-project/loculus) and its sequence database SILO.

sr2silo is designed to process a nucliotide alignments from `.bam` files with metadata, translate and align reads in amino acids, gracefully handling all insertions and deletions and upload the results to the backend [LAPIS-SILO](https://github.com/GenSpectrum/LAPIS-SILO).

### Setting up the repository

To build the package and maintain dependencies, we use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
In particular, it's good to install it and become familiar with its basic functionalities by reading the documentation.


### Installation

1. Build and set up the Conda environment using the Makefile:
   ```bash
   make setup
   ```
   This command creates the Conda environment (if not already created), installs Poetry, and sets up Diamond.

#### Additional Setup for Development

2. Install additional development dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install --with dev
   poetry run pre-commit install
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest
   ```

### Run CLI

TO ADD

### Tool Sections
The code quality checks run on GitHub can be seen in
 - ``.github/workflows/test.yml`` for the python package CI/CD,

We are using:

  * [Ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff) to lint the code.
  * [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) to format the code.
  * [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) to check the types.
  * [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) to run the unit tests code and workflows.
  * [Interrogate](https://interrogate.readthedocs.io/) to check the documentation.
