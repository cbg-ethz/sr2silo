### General Use: Convert Nucleotide Alignment Reads - CIGAR in .BAM to Cleartext JSON
sr2silo can convert millions of Short-Read nucleotide reads in the form of `.bam` CIGAR
alignments to cleartext alignments compatible with LAPIS-SILO v0.8.0+. It gracefully extracts insertions
and deletions. Optionally, sr2silo can translate and align each read using [diamond / blastX](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond), handling insertions and deletions in amino acid sequences as well.

Your input `.bam/.sam` with one line as:
```text
294 163 NC_045512.2 79  60  31S220M =   197 400 CTCTTGTAGAT FGGGHHHHLMM ...
```

sr2silo outputs per read a JSON (compatible with LAPIS-SILO v0.8.0+):

```json
{
  "readId": "AV233803:AV044:2411515907:1:10805:5199:3294",
  "sampleId": "A1_05_2024_10_08",
  "batchId": "20241024_2411515907",
  "samplingDate": "2024-10-08",
  "locationName": "Lugano (TI)",
  "readLength": "250",
  "primerProtocol": "v532",
  "locationCode": "5",
  "sr2siloVersion": "1.3.0",
  "main": {
    "sequence": "CGGTTTCGTCCGTGTTGCAGCCG...GTGTCAACATCTTAAAGATGGCACTTGTG",
    "insertions": ["10:ACTG", "456:TACG"],
    "offset": 4545
  },
  "S": {
    "sequence": "MESLVPGFNEKTHVQLSLPVLQVRVRGFGDSVEEVLSEARQHLKDGTCGLVEVEKGV",
    "insertions": ["23:A", "145:KLM"],
    "offset": 78
  },
  "ORF1a": {
    "sequence": "XXXMESLVPGFNEKTHVQLSLPVLQVRVRGFGDSVEEVLSEARQHLKDGTCGLV",
    "insertions": ["2323:TG", "2389:CA"],
    "offset": 678
  },
  "E": null,
  "M": null,
  "N": null,
  "ORF1b": null,
  "ORF3a": null,
  "ORF6": null,
  "ORF7a": null,
  "ORF7b": null,
  "ORF8": null,
  "ORF10": null
}
```

The total output is handled in an `.ndjson.zst`.

### Resource Requirements

When running sr2silo, particularly the `process-from-vpipe` command, be aware of memory and storage requirements:

- Standard configuration uses 8GB RAM and one CPU core
- Processing batches of 100k reads requires ~3GB RAM plus ~3GB for Diamond
- Temporary storage needs (especially on clusters) can reach 30-50GB

For detailed information about resource requirements, especially for cluster environments, please refer to the [Resource Requirements documentation](docs/usage/resource_requirements.md).

### Wrangling Short-Read Genomic Alignments for SILO Database

Originally this was started for wrangling short-read genomic alignments from wastewater-sampling, into a format for easy import into [Loculus](https://github.com/loculus-project/loculus) and its sequence database SILO.

sr2silo is designed to process nucleotide alignments from `.bam` files with metadata, translate and align reads in amino acids, gracefully handling all insertions and deletions and upload the results to the backend [LAPIS-SILO](https://github.com/GenSpectrum/LAPIS-SILO) v0.8.0+.

**Output Format for LAPIS-SILO v0.8.0+:**
- Metadata fields use camelCase naming (e.g., `readId`, `sampleId`, `batchId`) to align with Loculus standards
- Metadata fields are at the root level (no nested "metadata" object)
- Genomic segments use a structured format with `sequence`, `insertions`, and `offset` fields
- The main nucleotide segment is required and contains the primary alignment
- Gene segments (S, ORF1a, etc.) contain amino acid sequences or `null` if empty
- Insertions use the format `"position:sequence"` (e.g., `"123:ACGT"`)

**Output Schema Configuration:**

The output schema is defined in `src/sr2silo/silo_read_schema.py` using Pydantic models with field aliases for camelCase output. To modify the metadata fields:

1. Edit `src/sr2silo/silo_read_schema.py` - Add/modify fields in `ReadMetadata` class
2. Update `resources/silo/database_config.yaml` - Ensure field names match the Pydantic aliases
3. Run validation: `python tests/test_database_config_validation.py`

The validation ensures your Pydantic schema matches the SILO database configuration.

For the V-Pipe to Silo implementation we include the following metadata fields at the root level:
```json
{
  "readId": "AV233803:AV044:2411515907:1:10805:5199:3294",
  "sampleId": "A1_05_2024_10_08",
  "batchId": "20241024_2411515907",
  "samplingDate": "2024-10-08",
  "locationName": "Lugano (TI)",
  "readLength": "250",
  "primerProtocol": "v532",
  "locationCode": "5",
  "sr2siloVersion": "1.3.0"
}
```

### Setting up the repository

To build the package and maintain dependencies, we use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
In particular, it's good to install it and become familiar with its basic functionalities by reading the documentation.

### Installation

sr2silo can be installed either from Bioconda or from source.

#### Install from Bioconda

The easiest way to install sr2silo is through the Bioconda channel:

```bash
# Add necessary channels if you haven't already
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels conda-forge

# Install sr2silo
conda install sr2silo
```

#### Install from Source

For development purposes or to install the latest version, you can install from source using Poetry:

The project uses a modular environment system to separate core functionality, development requirements, and workflow dependencies. Environment files are located in the `environments/` directory:

##### Core Environment Setup

For basic usage of sr2silo:
```bash
make setup
```
This creates the core conda environment with essential dependencies and installs the package using Poetry.

##### Development Environment

For development work:
```bash
make setup-dev
```
This command sets up the development environment with Poetry.
##### Workflow Environment

For working with the snakemake workflow:
```bash
make setup-workflow
```
This creates an environment specifically configured for running the sr2silo in snakemake workflows.

##### All Environments

You can set up all environments at once:
```bash
make setup-all
```

### Additional Setup for Development

After setting up the development environment:
```bash
conda activate sr2silo-dev
poetry install --with dev
poetry run pre-commit install
```

### Run Tests

```bash
make test
```
or
```bash
conda activate sr2silo-dev
pytest
```

### Usage

sr2silo follows a two-step workflow:

1. **Process data:** `sr2silo process-from-vpipe --help`
2. **Submit to Loculus:** `sr2silo submit-to-loculus --help`

```bash
# Example: Process V-Pipe data
sr2silo process-from-vpipe \
    --input-file input.bam \
    --sample-id SAMPLE_001 \
    --timeline-file timeline.tsv \
    --output-fp output.ndjson

# Example: Submit to Loculus (use environment variables for credentials)
export KEYCLOAK_TOKEN_URL=https://auth.example.com/token
export BACKEND_URL=https://api.example.com/submit
export GROUP_ID=123
export USERNAME=your-username
export PASSWORD=your-password

sr2silo submit-to-loculus --processed-file output.ndjson.zst
```

**Note:** Use environment variables for credentials to avoid exposing sensitive information in command history.

**Note:** The `--lapis-url` parameter is optional. If not provided, sr2silo uses default SARS-CoV-2 references (NC_045512.2). See `sr2silo process-from-vpipe --help` for details.

### Environment Variable Configuration

sr2silo supports flexible configuration through environment variables, making it easy to use in different deployment scenarios including conda packages and pip installations.

**Key features:**
- CLI parameters override environment variables
- **Recommended for credentials to avoid exposing sensitive information in command history**

**Common configuration via environment variables:**
```bash
# Authentication credentials (recommended approach for security)
export KEYCLOAK_TOKEN_URL=https://auth.example.com/token
export BACKEND_URL=https://backend.example.com/api
export GROUP_ID=123
export USERNAME=your-username
export PASSWORD=your-password

# Run with environment variables set
sr2silo process-from-vpipe \
    --input-file input.bam \
    --sample-id SAMPLE_001 \
    --timeline-file /path/to/timeline.tsv \
    --output-fp output.ndjson

# Submission using environment variables for credentials
sr2silo submit-to-loculus \
    --processed-file output.ndjson.zst
```
